# Project Description
This website is built to guide prospective employers through my Github repositories
and highlight projects that I feel demonstrate my proficiencies in various programming
languages. Also, the website itself should serve as an example of my skill with html.
Having the website built while using VCS should also demonstrate my proficiency with 
Github at the same time.
